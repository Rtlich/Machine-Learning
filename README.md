🛠️ Machine Learning Project
Project for the ERP & BI course at Esprit School of Engineering.
It aims to optimize resource and operations management in an agri-food company using SAP MM & PM, with a focus on sustainability, CO₂ reduction, and predictive maintenance.

📊 Unsupervised Learning Objective (Clustering) - Supplier Analysis
🎯 Business Objective
The goal is to segment suppliers into homogeneous groups (clusters) in order to:

🚚 Optimize the supply chain
Identify similar suppliers to enable grouped negotiations.

Improve contract management and streamline logistics costs.

🌱 Enhance sustainability
Identify high-performing suppliers in terms of renewable energy usage or environmental certifications (e.g., ISO 14001).

Strengthen CSR policies (Corporate Social Responsibility).

🚨 Detect anomalies
Identify atypical suppliers, such as:

Highly polluting suppliers (risk for brand image or regulatory compliance).

Exceptionally green suppliers (ideal for strategic partnerships).

🚨 Supervised Learning Objective (Classification) - Automatic Alert Prioritization
🎯 Business Objective
The goal is to automatically classify the priority of alerts to:

⚡ Optimize incident management
Respond faster to critical alerts (e.g., equipment failure, critical stock levels).

Minimize impacts on production and services.

🛡️ Reduce false positive handling time
Quickly filter low-priority alerts.

Avoid wasting time on non-critical incidents.

🤖 Automate alert sorting
Eliminate the need for manual analysis.

Accelerate the sorting and decision-making process.

🧩 Improve resource allocation
Direct teams towards the most urgent issues.

Optimize the use of human and technical resources.

📈 Time Series Objective - CO₂ Emissions Forecasting
🎯 Business Objective
The goal is to predict future CO₂ emissions to:

⚙️ Optimize production
Anticipate pollution spikes and adjust industrial processes in real-time.

Reduce costs related to carbon taxes or environmental penalties.

🌍 Support sustainable planning
Assess the impact of ecological initiatives (e.g., transition to solar energy).

Align actions with CSR objectives (e.g., reduce emissions by X% by 2030).

🔧 Enable predictive maintenance
Detect anomalies, such as:

Faulty equipment emitting unusually high levels of CO₂.

Deviations from regulatory emission thresholds.
